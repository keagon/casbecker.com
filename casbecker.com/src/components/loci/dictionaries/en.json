      },
      {
        "question": "How private is it, really?",
        "answer": "Your data stays yours. We don't train on your conversations, we don't sell your data, and we don't build profiles to serve you ads. You can delete everything at any time. We're building privacy into the architecture, not bolting it on as an afterthought."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'runs on clean energy' mean?",
        "answer": "We host on infrastructure powered by renewable energy sources. We also choose efficient models that deliver great results without excessive compute. We won't pretend to give you exact carbon numbers (those calculations are complex) but we're committed to minimizing environmental impact at every decision point."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will it be as good as the best AI models?",
        "answer": "Honestly? No. The absolute cutting-edge models are resource-intensive by design. But you'll get 95%+ of the practical capability for daily use. For most real tasks like writing, research, coding help, and analysis, you won't notice the difference. What you will notice is not feeling guilty about using it."
      },
      {
        "question": "What am I paying for?",
        "answer": "Access to Loci's AI tools (LLM, search, canvas, multimodal), hosted on clean energy infrastructure. You're also supporting the development of an alternative model: small-scale, community-directed, privacy-respecting AI. Your €19/month keeps this independent and free from VC pressure to extract maximum value from users."
